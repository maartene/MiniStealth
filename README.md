# MiniStealth
Simple 'console' based roguelike/stealth game using SpriteKit and GameplayKit

In this tutorial series we're going to create a simple roguelike/stealth game using SpriteKit and GameplayKit. We will use SpriteKit to simulate a text based console (but we'll also use graphics), use GameplayKit for pathfinding and look at some common algorithms/patterns for visibility and AI.

GameplayKit features we're using in this series:
* Entity Component System: GKEntity & GKComponent
* State Machines: GKStateMachine & GKState
* Pathfinding: GKGridGraph & GKGridGraphNode
* Rule system: GKRuleSystem & GKRule
